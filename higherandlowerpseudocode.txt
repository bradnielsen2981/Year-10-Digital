HIGHER AND LOWER GAME

Pseudocode level 0 - write down the main elements of the problem
BEGIN
    computer chooses a random number
    player repeatedly has guesses at number until guess = number
    player is told higher or lower after every guess
END

Pseudocode level 1 - break down the main elements
BEGIN
    SET number = random number between 1-100
    INPUT guess
    WHILE guess not equal to number
        IF guess > number:
            OUTPUT lower
        ELSE IF guess < number
            OUTPUT higher
    OUTPUT 'well done you guessed the number 
END

>>WHERE IS THE LOGIC ERROR - CHECK THE ALGORITHM

BEGIN
    SET number = random number between 1-100
    INPUT guess
    WHILE guess not equal to number
        IF guess > number:
            OUTPUT lower
        ELSE IF guess < number
            OUTPUT higher
        INPUT guess
    OUTPUT 'well done you guessed the number 
END

Pseudocode level 2 - add more to the problem
BEGIN
    SET number_of_lives = 7 
    SET number = random number between 1-100
    INPUT guess
    WHILE (guess not equal to number) AND (number_of_lives > 0)
        number_of_lives = number_of_lives - 1 
        IF guess > number:
            OUTPUT lower
        ELSE IF guess < number
            OUTPUT higher
        INPUT GUESS
    IF number_of_lives > 0
        OUTPUT 'well done you guessed the number' 
END

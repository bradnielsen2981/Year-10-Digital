Pseudocode level 0 - broad outline of the problm

BEGIN
    computer choose a random move from paper scissor rock
    human inputs a move from paper scissors or rock
    do logic to determine the winner using (Rock beat Scissors beats Paper beats..)
    Repeat until player wants to exit
END

Pseudocode level 1a - break it down more
BEGIN
    SET playermove = '' 
    movelist = ['paper','scissors','rock]
    WHILE playermove != 'exit'
        IF playermove not in movelist
            INPUT playermove
            CONTINUE
        SET computermove = random item from movelist
        do logic to determine the winner using (Rock beat Scissors beats Paper beats..)
        INPUT playermove
END

Pseudocode level 1b - break it down even more
BEGIN
    SET playermove = '' 
    movelist = ['paper','scissors','rock]
    WHILE playermove != 'exit'
        
        IF playermove not in movelist
            INPUT playermove
            CONTINUE //skip the rest of the loop
        SET computermove = random item from movelist
        
        IF computermove equals playermove

            OUTPUT draw

        ELSE IF (computermove equals 'rock' AND player equals 'scissors')
            OR (computermove equals 'scissors' AND player equals 'paper')
            OR (computermove equals 'paper' AND player equals 'rock')

            OUTPUT computer wins
        ELSE
            OUTPUT player wins

        INPUT playermove
END   

Pseudocode level 2 - add to it
BEGIN
    SET playerscore = 0
    SET computerscore = 0 
    SET playermove = '' 
    movelist = ['paper','scissors','rock]
    WHILE playermove != 'exit'
        
        IF playermove not in movelist
            INPUT playermove
            CONTINUE //skip the rest of the loop
        SET computermove = random item from movelist
        
        IF computermove equals playermove

            OUTPUT draw

        ELSE IF (computermove equals 'rock' and player equals 'scissors')
            OR (computermove equals 'scissors' and player equals 'paper')
            OR (computermove equals 'paper' and player equals 'rock')

            OUTPUT computer wins
            computerscore = computerscore + 1
        ELSE
            OUTPUT player wins
            playerscore = playerscore + 1

        OUTPUT scores
        INPUT playermove
END
